### Deploy 
```
Observation:
The app is not fully responsive I recommend to use Google Chrome and set the resolution of the web browser in 1366px x 632px, the app is usable in higher resolutions but the optimal view of the components is in this resolution or more.

I deploy the app in a Virtual Machine in Google Cloud using Docker, the link is the following:
http://35.223.179.80:3000/
